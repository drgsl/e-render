Rendering Engine / Game Engine

would like to be flexible because i might upgrade to DirectX or Vulkan in the future.

I want this to have some PHIGS complete methods that fasciliate the inner workings of the engine.

the end user should be fascilitated with Awake, Late-Awake, Start, Update/Fixed-Update/Late-Update, 


the engine could work with just Setup and Loop and in this one to define all the other ones.
